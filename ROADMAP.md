# CRM Roadmap

## Product & Platform Needs
- Tasking layer: explicit tasks with owners, due dates, and status beyond notes/activities.
- Bulk actions: assign owner, update stage, and trigger sync across multiple artists.
- Tagging/segments: beyond status/genre, for campaign segmentation and saved lists.
- Contact model: multiple contacts per artist instead of a single contactName/contactRole/email field.
- Outbound comms: email logging, template snippets, and "last contacted" tracking.
- Reporting: pipeline stats (conversion by stage), win/loss reasons, and owner performance.
- Data quality: duplicate detection on import and manual entry, plus validation for URLs/emails.
- Release history: store more than "latest release" to support calendar history and trends.
- User/role management: admin is a single hard-coded email in src/lib/auth.ts.
